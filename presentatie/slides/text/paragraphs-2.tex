	The agitation for the Universal Colour Bill 
	continued for three years; and up to the 
	last moment of that period it seemed as 
	though Anarchy were destined to triumph.

	A whole army of Polygons, who turned out 
	to fight as private soldiers, was utterly 
	annihilated by a superior force of Isosceles 
	Triangles --- the Squares and Pentagons 
	meanwhile remaining neutral.
