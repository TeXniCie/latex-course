\section{How I tried to teach the Theory of Three Dimensions to my 
Grandson, and with what success}
I awoke rejoicing, and began to reflect on the glorious career before me. 
I would go forth, methought, at once, and evangelize the whole of Flatland. 
Even to Women and Soldiers should the Gospel of Three Dimensions 
be proclaimed. I would begin with my Wife.
