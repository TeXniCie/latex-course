%%% This is a bib file. In here, you add all the used bibliography and (using BibTeX) LaTeX will automatically create nice citations and an bibliography.


% This is straight forward! Just copy the kind of thing you have and it will work

% Note that you don't have to name your article 'article', the name should be something you can remember in order to cite it. The name or cite-id is the first argument after the opening bracket.

% For a nice matrix of allowed fields, see:
% https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management#biblatex

% Every type allows an 'url' and/or 'doi', but it's not required.
